👋🏽 Hello, I'm Piers.

🎓 I'm on the verge of completing my Master's of Science in Computer Science, with graduation set for September 2024.

💡 I have a deep-seated passion for problem-solving and crafting efficient algorithms. In the past, I've worked on several projects that required me to develop and implement complex data structures and algorithms. I've also had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams, which has enriched my understanding of software development methodologies.

📚 I’ve honed my skills in Python, MERN stack, Git, CSS, REST, Redux and Passport.js through various roles and projects. I’ve developed blockchain solutions at Cognizant, migrated an iOS app to a web app at vConstruct, built a full-stack e-commerce app for The Sparks Foundation, and created a blogging platform for my final year project.

💻 As I look to the future, my goal is to secure a role as a Software Developer where I can contribute to creating innovative solutions and work with a team that values diversity and inclusion. I'm particularly interested in exploring fields like AI and machine learning.

🏔 When I'm not immersed in code, you can often find me exploring the great outdoors, hiking, and camping.

💪🏽 My strengths lie in my analytical skills, proficiency in various programming languages (like Python, Java, and Javascript) and my ability to work well in a team. I'm also experienced in Agile methodologies, software testing, and debugging. My passion for continuous learning keeps me updated with the latest trends in software development.
